This is a Planning/Activity Tracking app, which means that there is a calendar that the individual dates can be pressed and that
brings up a list of the activities that are planned for that day as well a button to add new activities. When adding a new
activity, the user can specify which location they intend to go and the app will have the (yahoo weather api) weather for that day.
The app can also record the location with another button, for future use. The app records all information in a database, 
and past activities are kept to remind the user what they have done.

Features  
Button to Record Location
Button to add a location remotely (potentially using map)
Button to see weather for a location
Calendar (days clickable), shows activity list for day (past and future)
